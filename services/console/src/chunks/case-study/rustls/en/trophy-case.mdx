## Trophy Case

- [PR #1640][pr 1640]: One of the first uses of the Rustls continuous benchmarking integration for evaluating the transition from `write_vectored` to `write`. This change improved the Rustls send-direction transfer benchmarks by almost 20% in some cases.
- [PR #1730][pr 1730]: Found performance regressions when randomizing the order of TLS ClientHello extensions. This resulted in another iteration of development and the use of a more efficient approach.
- [PR #1834][pr 1834]: Helped to quickly validate a critical security fix did no introduce a performance regression. This allowed the team to focus on getting multiple security patched versions released quickly.
