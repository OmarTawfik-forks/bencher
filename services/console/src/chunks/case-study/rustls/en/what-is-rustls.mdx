## What is Rustls?
[Rustls][rustls] is a modern Transport Layer Security (TLS) library written in Rust,
with the aim of replacing non-memory safe alternatives such as OpenSSL.
The TLS protocol is used to provide secure communications,
typically between a web server and a client.
TLS was previously called Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
It ensures that the data transmitted between the two parties is encrypted
and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.
Therefore, it is vital for a TLS library like Rustls to be both fast and secure.
