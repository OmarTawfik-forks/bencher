## Continuous Benchmarking for Rustls
In order to catch performance regressions before they get released,
the Rustls project decided to invest in [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking].

> Continuous Benchmarking is a software development practice where members of a team benchmark their work frequently,
> usually each person benchmarks at least daily - leading to multiple benchmarks per day.
> Each benchmark is verified by an automated build to detect performance regressions as quickly as possible.
> Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced performance regressions
> and allows a team to develop performant software more rapidly.

The Rustls project's continuous benchmarking solution consists of two main components:
- [CI Bench][ci bench]: A custom benchmarking harness designed specifically for running benchmarks in CI
- [Bench Runner][rustls bench app]: A custom, bare metal continuous benchmarking server and companion GitHub App
