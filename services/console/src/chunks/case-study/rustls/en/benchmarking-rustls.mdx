## Benchmarking Rustls
Rustls first commit was made by the project's creator [Joseph Birr-Pixton][ctz] on 02 May 2016
with the first successful TLS connection not happening until the 27th of that same month.
By that September, he was [already benchmarking Rustls][bay area rust].
With substantial performance improvements under his belt,
he did [a head-to-head benchmark comparison of Rustls vs OpenSSL][rustls vs openssl 2019] in July 2019.

The results from that benchmark comparison were:
- Rustls was 15% quicker to send data.
- Rustls was 5% quicker to receive data.
- Rustls was 20-40% quicker to set up a client connection.
- Rustls was 10% quicker to set up a server connection.
- Rustls was 30-70% quicker to resume a client connection.
- Rustls was 10-20% quicker to resume a server connection.
- Rustls used less than half the memory of OpenSSL.

In 2023, the Internet Security Research Group [funded performance benchmarking of the Rustls project][rustls performance],
and that generated [an updated head-to-head benchmark comparison of Rustls vs OpenSSL][rustls vs openssl 2023].
Though these updated results were informative for the Rustls project
on both areas of strength and areas to improve,
the largest performance concern is now on guaranteeing that _new_ code does not introduce a performance regression.
