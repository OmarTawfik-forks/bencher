### Rustls CI Bench
CI Bench is a best-in-class harness for continuous benchmarking.
It runs the exact same benchmark in two different modes: instruction count mode and wall-time mode.
This is accomplished using an ingenious custom async runtime.
For instruction count mode, the I/O is actually still blocking.
Under the hood, tasks just complete in a single poll.
Then for wall-time mode, the I/O is really non-blocking.
This allows for simulating shared, in-memory buffers.
The server and client are polled in turns.
This allows CI Bench to eliminate the noise and non-determinism of an async runtime in their benchmarks.

Rustls chose to track CPU instructions using [cachegrind][cachegrind].
This decision was modeled after [the Rust compiler's continuous benchmarking solution][rustc perf].
Instruction counts provide a very consistent way to compare two versions of the same software.
This makes it ideal for continuous benchmarking.
However, it is not possible to infer the actual runtime cost of an instruction count increase.
A 10% increase in instructions does not necessarily result in a 10% increase in runtime performance.
But a significant increase in instructions likely means that there is some increase in runtime performance.
For this reason, CI Bench also measures wall-time.

Wall-time is the thing that the Rustls project really cares about.
Measuring instruction counts is just a useful proxy.
Instruction count based benchmarking can't disambiguate changes that use the same number of instructions
but lead to wildly different wall-time performance.
For example, a new algorithm may happen to have the exact same number of instructions but run twice as slow.
