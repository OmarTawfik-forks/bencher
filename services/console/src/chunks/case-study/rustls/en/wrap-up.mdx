## Wrap Up
Building on the foundation set by the project's creator,
[Adolfo Ochagavía][aochagavia] has built an impressive continuous benchmarking solution for the Rustls project.
This includes a custom benchmarking harness that runs both instruction count and wall-time benchmarks for the same test,
a custom benchmark runner, a custom GitHub App, and a custom, dedicated bare metal server.
It is one of the most impressive [project specific continuous benchmarking solutions][prior art] out there.
If your project has the time and resources to build and maintain a bespoke continuous benchmarking solution,
the Rustls project sets a high bar to aim for.

A very special thank you to Adolfo Ochagavía for reviewing this case study.
His blog posts on [Continuous Benchmarking for Rustls][Continuous benchmarking for rustls]
and [Rustls performance][rustls performance] were the basis for its content.
