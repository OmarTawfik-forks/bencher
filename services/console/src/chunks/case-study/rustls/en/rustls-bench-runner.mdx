### Rustls Bench Runner
The Rustls Bench Runner is custom continuous benchmarking server.
It is designed to run on a bare metal host,
and it receives events from a companion GitHub App via webhooks.
On every push to the `main` branch,
the Bench Runner runs both the instruction count and wall-time benchmarks.
The results are stored locally and
sent to [the Rustls project on Bencher][bencher rustls] using the [Bencher API][bencher api].

Whenever a pull request is approved
or a comment containing `@rustls-benchmarking bench` is left by a Rustls maintainer,
the benchmarking suite is run.
The Bench Runner receives a webhook from GitHub,
pulls the code for the pull request,
runs the instruction count benchmarks,
runs the wall-time benchmarks,
compares the pull request results to the target `main` branch results,
and then posts the results as a comment on the pull request.
The Bench Runner uses a [Delta Interquartile Range model][delta iqr] for its statistical threshold
to determine whether a performance regression has ocurred.
Results that exceed this threshold are highlighted in the pull request comment.
