## Wrap Up

The Diesel project and Georg Semmler in particular have put a lot of time and effort into making sure that Diesel stays fast.
They have a comprehensive benchmarking suite that can be run both locally and in CI for wall clock based benchmarks.
The instruction count based benchmarks must be run locally, which requires a little more effort by the maintainers to use.
They also track their benchmark results over time in order to spot any unforeseen performance changes.

In addition to benchmarking themselves, they have also created and maintained a comparative benchmarking suite.
This allows Diesel to compare themselves against the other eight most popular ORMs in the Rust ecosystem.
They use this comparison as a chance to learn from other ORMs on where they can improve.

Diesel has woven together a patchwork of benchmarking solutions to catch performance regressions before they get released.
If your project does not have the time and resources to build and maintain a bespoke continuous benchmarking solution,
[like the Rustls project][rustls] then you may want to take a page from the Diesel project's playbook.

A very special thank you to Georg Semmler for reviewing this case study.
