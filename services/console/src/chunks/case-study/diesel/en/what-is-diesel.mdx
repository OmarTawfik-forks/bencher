## What is Diesel?

[Diesel][github diesel] is a safe, extensible object relational mapper (ORM) and query builder for Rust.
An ORM is used to translate between a relational database and a programming language.
Diesel is a strongly typed ORM.
It checks all database interactions at compile time, preventing runtime errors.
This compile time checking also makes Diesel a zero-cost abstraction over SQL.
By eliminating all the boilerplate, Diesel lets you focus on what really matters in your Rust code.

Diesel supports [the three most popular open source databases][stackoverflow databases]:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite

There is also a third-party crate that extends Diesel
to add support for [Oracle][github diesel oci].
