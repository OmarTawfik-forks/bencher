## Trophy Case

- [PR #3180][pr 3180]: The benchmarks caught a >13% performance regression in boxed query performance.
- [PR #2774][pr 2774] | [PR #2788][pr 2788] | [PR #3098][pr 3098]: The benchmarks showed that the proposed optimizations were not necessary.
That is, they did not result in the expected performance improvements, so they were not merged.
- [PR #2799][pr 2799]: The benchmarks caught a slight performance regressions in the SQLite and MySQL backends.
These regressions were deemed acceptable by the maintainers given the ergonomic improvements afforded by the changes.
- [PR #2827][pr 2827]: The benchmarks showed that using prepared statements for inserts improved performance by >10% and up to 2x-3x for SQLite.
- [PR #2931][pr 2931]: The benchmarks showed that rewriting the bind serialization layer for SQLite created a >35% performance improvement on inserts.
- [PR #3109][pr 3109]: The instruction count based benchmarks show that optimizing the SQLite statement iterator lead to a 1-6% improvement in query performance.
- [PR #3110][pr 3110]: The instruction count based benchmarks showed that inlining building from a SQL row lead to a 5% improvement.
- [PR #3944][pr 3944]: This was the first pull request to use the new Bencher integration!
The benchmarks still had to be run locally in order to detect a performance regression.
So let's take this chance to celebrate a false negative and tune those thresholds!
