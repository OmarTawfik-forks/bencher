## Continuous Benchmarking for Diesel

Before Diesel started to track their benchmarks,
Georg Semmler set up [Relative Continuous Benchmarking][relative continuous benchmarking] for the Diesel project.
Between 02 November 2020 and 29 January 2021,
he [add a GitHub Actions workflow][github actions diesel benches] that was activated via a `run-benchmarks` label on a pull request.
Once the label was added, GitHub Actions would run the benchmarks on both the current `master` and the PR branch
and then compare the results using [`critcmp`][github critcmp].
Due to security concerns around [pwn requests][github pwn requests], he had not yet found a way to safely post the results to the PR itself.
This meant that the benchmark results had to be manually inspected to detect a performance regression,
and the results would [be deleted in 90 days][github actions logs].

After finding out about [Bencher][bencher],
he wanted to take advantage of Bencher's [advanced statistical thresholds and alerts][thresholds]
and Bencher's [ability to safely comment on pull requests][github actions].
Bencher was also flexible enough to allow Diesel to still use it's `run-benchmarks` tag and keep `critcmp` as a fallback.
With these changes [merge into Diesel on 23 February 2024][github issue 3849],
they are now able to more easily compare their Relative Continuous Benchmarking results
and catch performance regressions in pull requests.
