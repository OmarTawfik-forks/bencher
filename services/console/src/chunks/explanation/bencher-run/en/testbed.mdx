### `--testbed <TESTBED>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--testbed` option or the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable
may be set to the name, slug, or UUID of an already existing testbed.
If both are specified, the `--testbed` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable.
If neither are specified then `localhost` is used as the default testbed.
