Depending on your use case, you can set up [Continuous Benchmarking][continuous benchmarking] in GitHub Actions for your:

- [Base Branch][base branch]
- [Pull Requests][pull requests]
- [Pull Requests from Forks][fork pull requests]
    - ⛑️ Safer: [Benchmark Fork PR and Upload from Default Branch][benchmark fork pr and upload from default branch]
    - ⚠️ Riskier: [Benchmark Fork PR from Target Branch with Required Reviewers][benchmark fork pr from target branch with required reviewers]

> 🐰 Make sure you have [created an API token][create an api token]
> and set it as a **Repository** secret named `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` before continuing on!
> Navigate to `Your Repo -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret`.
> Name the secret `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and set the secret value to your API token.
