## Pull Requests from Forks

If you plan to accept pull requests from forks, as is often the case in public open source projects,
then you will need to handle things a little differently.
For security reasons, secrets such as your `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` are not available in GitHub Actions for fork PRs.
That is if an external contributor opens up a PR from a fork the above example will **not** work.
There are two options for fork PRs:

- ⛑️ Safer: [Benchmark Fork PR and Upload from Default Branch][benchmark fork pr and upload from default branch]
- ⚠️ Riskier: [Benchmark Fork PR from Target Branch with Required Reviewers][benchmark fork pr from target branch with required reviewers]

See this [GitHub Security Lab write up][github actions pwn requests]
and [this blog post][nathandavison.com blog]
on preventing pwn requests for a full overview.
