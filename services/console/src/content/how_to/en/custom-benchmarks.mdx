Bencher supports [the most popular benchmarking harnesses][adapters] out-of-the-box,
and we are always [open to suggestions][github issue] for new adapters.
However there can be situations where an off-the-shelf benchmarking harness doesn't fit your needs,
necessitating the creation of a custom benchmarking harness.
Lucky for you, Bencher also supports using a custom benchmarking harness.
The easiest way to integrate your custom benchmark harness with Bencher
is to output [Bencher Metric Format (BMF) JSON][bmf json].

This is an example of BMF JSON:

<BmfExample />




If the BMF JSON is stored in a file,
then you can use the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand with the optional `--file` option to specify that file path.
This works both with a benchmark command (ex: `bencher run --file results.json "bencher mock > results.json"`)
and without a benchmark command (ex: `bencher mock > results.json && bencher run --file results.json`).

```shell
bencher run --file results.json "bencher mock > results.json"
```

```shell
bencher mock > results.json && bencher run --file results.json
```
