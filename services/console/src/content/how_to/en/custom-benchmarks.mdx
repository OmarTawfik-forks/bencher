Bencher supports [the most popular benchmarking harnesses][adapters] out-of-the-box,
and we are always [open to suggestions][github issue] for new adapters.
However there can be situations where an off-the-shelf benchmarking harness doesn't fit your needs,
necessitating the creation of a custom benchmarking harness.
Lucky for you, Bencher also supports using a custom benchmarking harness.
