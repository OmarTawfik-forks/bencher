With all that in mind, if you are looking to benchmark your code's wall clock time
then you should probably use Criterion.
If you are looking to [benchmark your code in CI][continuous benchmarking]
with shared runners then it may be worth checking out Iai.
Note though, Iai hasn't been update [in over 3 years][github iai].
So you might consider [using Iai-Callgrind][adapters iai callgrind] instead.

But what if you don't want to benchmark wall clock time or instruction counts?
What if you want to track some completely different benchmark‽
Luckily, Rust makes it incredibly easy to create a custom benchmarking harness.

## How `cargo bench` Works

Before building a custom benchmarking harness,
we need to understand how Rust benchmarks work.
For most Rust developers this means running [the `cargo bench` command][cargo bench].
The `cargo bench` command compiles and executes your benchmarks.
By default, `cargo bench` will try to use the built-in (but unstable) libtest bench harness.
libtest bench will then go through your code and run all functions annotated with the `#[bench]` attribute.
In order to use a custom benchmarking harness, we need to tell `cargo bench` to not use libtest bench.

[cargo bench]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-bench.html

## Using a Non-Default Benchmarking Harness

To get `cargo bench` to not use libtest bench,
we need to add the following to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[[bench]]
harness = false
```

Unfortunately, we can't use the `#[bench]` attribute with our custom benchmarking harness.
[Maybe one day soon][github issue 2], but not today.
Instead, we have to create a separate `benches` directory to hold our benchmarks.
The `benches` directory is to benchmarks
what [the `tests` directory][tests directory] is to integration tests.
Each file inside of the `benches` directory is treated as a separate crate.
The crate being benchmarked must therefore be a library crate.
That is, it must have a `lib.rs` file.

For example, if we had a basic library crate named `game`
then we could add a custom benchmark file named `play_game` to the `benches` directory.
Our directory structure would look like this:

```txt ins={4-5}
game
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── benches
    └── play_game.rs
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

Next we need to let `cargo bench` know about our custom benchmark crate `play_game`.
So we update our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml title="Cargo.toml" ins={2}
[[bench]]
name = "play_game"
harness = false
```

## Creating a Custom Benchmarking Harness

Inside of `benches/play_game` we are going to create our very own custom benchmarking harness.
First though, we need to decide what it is we are going to measure and therefore benchmark.
For our example, we are going to measure heap allocations using [the `dhat-rs` crate][crates dhat].
`dhat-rs` is a fantastic tool for measuring heap allocations in Rust programs
by Rust performance expert [Nicholas Nethercote][github nnethercote].
To help us manage our heap allocation benchmarks,
we will be using [the `inventory` crate][crates inventory]
by the astoundingly prolific [David Tolnay][github dtolnay].

Let's add `dhat-rs` and `inventory` to our `Cargo.toml` file as `dev-dependencies`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dev-dependencies]
dhat = "0.3"
inventory = "0.3"
```
